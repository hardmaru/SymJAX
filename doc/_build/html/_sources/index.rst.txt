Welcome to SymJAX's documents
=============================

- `JAX`_ = `XLA`_ + `Autograd`_
- `SymJAX`_ =  `JAX`_ + symbolic programming + deep Learning

`XLA`_ is a compiler that optimizes a computational graph by fusing multiple kernels into one preventing intermediate computation, reducing memory operations and increasing performances.

`JAX`_ is a python interface that provides a `Numpy`_-like software on top of XLA and providing just-in-time compilation a well as advanced automatic differenciation.

`SymJAX`_ is a symbolic programming version of `JAX`_ simplifying graph input, output and updates and providing additional functionalities for general machine learning and deep learning applications. From an user perspective `SymJAX`_ apparents to `Theano`_ with fast graph optimization/compilation and broad hardware support, along with `Lasagne`_-like deep learning functionalities


This is an under development research project, not an official product, expect bugs and sharp edges; please help by trying it out, reporting bugs.
